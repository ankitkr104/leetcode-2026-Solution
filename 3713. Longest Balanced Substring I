You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

A substring of s is called balanced if all distinct characters in the substring appear the same number of times.

Return the length of the longest balanced substring of s.

 

Example 1:

  Input: s = "abbac"

  Output: 4

  Explanation:

    The longest balanced substring is "abba" because both distinct characters 'a' and 'b' each appear exactly 2 times.


Example 2:

  Input: s = "zzabccy"

  Output: 4

  Explanation:

    The longest balanced substring is "zabc" because the distinct characters 'z', 'a', 'b', and 'c' each appear exactly 1 time.​​​​​​​


Example 3:

  Input: s = "aba"

  Output: 2

  Explanation:

    ​​​​​​​One of the longest balanced substrings is "ab" because both distinct characters 'a' and 'b' each appear exactly 1 time. Another longest balanced substring is "ba".

 

Constraints:

  1 <= s.length <= 1000
  s consists of lowercase English letters.


Solution (python):

class Solution:
    def longestBalanced(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        ans = 0
        
        for l in range(n):
            freq = [0] * 26
            distinct = 0
            max_freq = 0
            
            for r in range(l, n):
                idx = ord(s[r]) - ord('a')
                
                if freq[idx] == 0:
                    distinct += 1
                
                freq[idx] += 1
                max_freq = max(max_freq, freq[idx])
                
                length = r - l + 1
                
                if length == distinct * max_freq:
                    ans = max(ans, length)
        
        return ans
