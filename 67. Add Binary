Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

 

Example 1:

  Input: a = "11", b = "1"
  Output: "100"


Example 2:

  Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
  Output: "10101"
 

Constraints:

  1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10power4
  a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
  Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

Solution (python):

class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a, b):
        i = len(a) - 1
        j = len(b) - 1
        carry = 0
        result = []

        while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
            bit_a = int(a[i]) if i >= 0 else 0
            bit_b = int(b[j]) if j >= 0 else 0
            
            total = bit_a + bit_b + carry
            result.append(str(total % 2))
            carry = total // 2
            
            i -= 1
            j -= 1

        return ''.join(result[::-1])
